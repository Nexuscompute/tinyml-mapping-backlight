<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- linkvideo -->

An intelligent assistant device to track moves with responses during a dance performance or an interactive building with mapping and Backlight.

This project makes use of a machine learning algorithm capable of tracking and detecting moves to identify associated gesture recognition through a microcontroller. This allows the corresponding media, lightning and kinetic sculpture set to play when the right move was made because lighting interacts with all the visuals of a stage creating a new experience.


### Motivation

Some facts:
-There are a lot of new art projects adding technology nowadays.
-Factors like the difficulties that artists come up with during their attempts to familiarize with new technologies, so that they can integrate them in their projects.
-High cost of buying and installing new software together with its supporting systems.
-Limited access that a large percentage of the student population has to new technologies made it sometimes **difficult to use technology in dance**.

##### Technology in art can be an element for good, but only when everyone is included.

Interactive multimedia is one of the most important applications of technology. It is one of the most accessible technological innovations, which does not require expert knowledge in computer programming. Interactive multimedia involves a lot of elements (i.e. text, image, sound, graphics, etc.) all included in an easy learning environment where creative action and inquiry have the primary role.

### Built With

With a lot of love üíñ, motivation to help others üí™üèº and [Python](https://www.python.org/) üêç, using:

* [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/favicon.ico" width="15"> (with its wonderful GPUs)
* Model quantization with `tf.lite` for serving ‚öôÔ∏è
* Encode the Model in an Arduino Header File

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them. 

For this particular section I will suppose that you already have a Raspberry Pi already setup. If not I have a guide in Medium about [getting started on Raspberry Pi 4](https://fullmakeralchemist.medium.com/setting-up-your-raspberry-pi-4-wireless-f51c16937d1e). Also you will need git installed on your system. If not, I have a guide posted on [Medium](https://fullmakeralchemist.medium.com/install-git-and-visual-studio-code-on-raspberry-pi-48d054fdee07) to do it .
For a general overview of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense setup, you can check out the Arduino Guide on [Getting started with Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33BLESense).

Before installing the libraries in Raspberry Pi run the following code lines in the Raspberry Pi terminal:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
After updating and upgrading we will write the following command:

```
sudo pip install python-vlc
```

To install the Mosquitto Broker enter these next commands:

```
pi@raspberry:~ $ sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```
